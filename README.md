# GameOfLife
Implementation of John Conway's Game of Life in C++ using SDL (https://www.libsdl.org/), with the idea of it being a sandbox style app that allows the user to choose the initial state.

# Installation
Download the GameOfLife.zip file and extract the contents. Run the executable in the same folder as the SDL.dll

# Controls
* Click and drag your mouse to paint cells as "alive"
* Spacebar to start and stop the simulation
* E to advance the simulation by one step
* C to make every cell "dead"
